With waterlogged ground, rain can not runoff and an extreme heavy rain storm, or multiple storms, will drop vast amounts of rain on the region causing flooding. If this cycle repeats over a short period, emergency services will be stretched to the point where critical services can not be adequately restored between flooding events and the town will appear to lose its operational capacity.</p><p style="height: 6px;"><strong>Examples</strong></p><div><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/50th-anniversary-of-the-devastating-floods-in-east-devon">50th anniversary of the devastating floods in East Devon</a></div><div><a href="http://winterstorms2014.cornwalllive.com/index.html?_ga=2.155157880.1766160660.1572436084-199460602.1482156814">A winter Cornwall will never forget</a></div><div><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/25/weather.flooding1">The great floods of 1947</a></div></div></div><div class="d-grid gap-2 ms-1"><a class="btn btn-primary mb-5 mt-2" role="button" href="resilience.html" style="width: 33%;margin: 0px;margin-left: 33%;" display="inline-block">Back</a></div></div></div></div></div><script src="../../assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
