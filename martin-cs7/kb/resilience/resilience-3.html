Typically, droughts are&nbsp;caused by insufficient water resources availability due to reduced precipitation over a period of time, or long-term over-exploitation of surface water and groundwater.</p><div><div><h1 align="left">Minor Resilience Challenge</h1><p>In the UK, minor drought challenges often occur with heat waves, in that a period of hot weather will also incorporate a dry spell of no rain. For regions such as the South West, drinking water is primarily supplied through reservoirs which will generally have ample stored water given the long wet winters that the region faces. However, dry periods and heatwaves towards the middle to end of the summer may create drought risk and the local water company will respond with restrictions on unnecessary consumption, such as temporary hose pipe bans.</p><p style="height: 6px;"><strong>Examples</strong></p><div><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2022-07-10/south-west-told-to-use-less-water-and-save-for-influx-of-tourists">People in the South West told to use less water and save for influx of tourists</a></div><div><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/westcountry/2023-08-22/south-west-water-to-remove-hosepipe-ban-after-13-months">South West Water to remove hosepipe ban in Cornwall after 13 months</a></div><div><a href="https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/cornwalls-first-hosepipe-ban-26-7463874">Cornwall's first hosepipe ban in 26 years imposed by South West Water</a></div></div><div><h1 class="mt-1" align="left">Average Resilience Challenge</h1><p>For drought challenges to escalate to average in the UK, there normally needs to be a combination of a dry winter and an earlier than expected summer heatwave. Typically, storage reservoirs are filled during winter rains, but if the winter is drier than expected, regions will have fewer reserves.</p><p style="height: 6px;"><strong>Examples</strong></p><div><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-67964356">South West Water 'not well prepared' for 2022 drought, emails claim</a></div><div><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-67753173">Will 2024 see South West Water break the cycle of drought?</a></div><div><a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2024/01/15/south-west-water-drought-risk-water-supplies/">South West Water was ‘not honest’ about drought risk to water supplies, Environment Agency said</a></div></div><div><h1 class="mt-2" align="left">Major Resilience Challenge</h1><p>Major drought challenges typically occur through multiple cycles prolonged summer heatwaves and dry winters.</p><p style="height: 6px;"><strong>Examples</strong></p><div><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxgelz7dw9o">Union hits out at plan to import water from Norway</a></div><div><a href="https://www.bigga.org.uk/news-listing/golf-course-extreme-weather-conditions-drought.html">Here's how your course can mitigate the extreme weather conditions</a></div><div><a href="https://consult.environment-agency.gov.uk/environment-and-business/drought-how-it-is-managed-in-england/supporting_documents/Drought%20%20How%20it%20is%20managed%20in%20England.pdf">Drought: how it is managed in England</a></div></div></div><div class="d-grid gap-2 ms-1"><a class="btn btn-primary mb-5 mt-2" role="button" href="resilience.html" style="width: 33%;margin: 0px;margin-left: 33%;" display="inline-block">Back</a></div></div><script src="../../assets/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
