However, they are now becoming both more frequent and longer-lasting when they do occur. This puts increasing heat stress on to the community, in that vulnerable people will suffer hard for longer and require specialised care. Also, the heat wave puts increasing stress on community infrastructure with frequent anecdotes about transport failure (melting roads, vehicle failing and so on).&nbsp;</p><p style="height: 6px;"><strong>Examples</strong></p><div><a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/blog/2024/the-unbelievable-may-that-had-everyone-talking#:~:text=The%20May%202024%20marine%20heatwave,by%200.8%2D1.0%C2%B0C.">The unbelievable May that had everyone talking</a></div><div><a href="https://www.tavistock-today.co.uk/news/wildfire-warnings-in-hot-dry-weather-620320">Wildfire warnings in hot dry weather</a></div><div><a href="https://www.sidmouthherald.co.uk/news/23773511.hospital-under-pressure-east-devon-experiences-heatwave/">Hospital 'under pressure' as East Devon experiences heatwave</a></div></div><div><h1 class="mt-2" align="left">Major Resilience Challenge</h1><p>Major heat wave challenges occur when heat waves start to become the new normal, with traditional periods of cool weather and rainfall becoming less frequent. This is often viewed as climate adaptation where communities start to under take measures which until recently would have been considered unnecessary, such as the widespread uptake of residential air conditioning, municipalities developing heat plans and so on.</p><p style="height: 6px;"><strong>Examples</strong></p><div><a href="https://skoot.eco/articles/5-reasons-why-the-heatwave-of-1976-is-so-very-different-to-2022#:~:text=Some%20areas%20experienced%20months%20without,surpassed%20in%20the%2021st%20century.">1976 Summer Temperatures</a></div><div><a href="https://exepose.com/2022/10/08/effects-of-devon-heatwave/">How has one of the hottest summers on record affected Devon?</a></div><div><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-62508257">UK heatwave: Devon gritters prepped to deal with melting roads</a></div></div></div><div class="d-grid gap-2 ms-1"><a class="btn btn-primary mb-5 mt-2" role="button" href="resilience.html" style="width: 33%;margin: 0px;margin-left: 33%;" display="inline-block">Back</a></div></div></div></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="../../assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
